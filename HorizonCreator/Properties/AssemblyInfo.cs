[assembly: AssemblyMetadata("LongDescription", @"How to use:
1. Connect to your mount (needs to be roughly polar aligned)
2. Move the mount to the obstruction (Scope Control plugin recommended), center it and press 'Add Point'. Repeat for all points you want to create a horizon from.
3. Click 'Save' and choose the desired location


To see your obstruction, I recommend making a looping exposure / live view or using an eyepiece")]
